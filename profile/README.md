## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is a future home to our open source bits. Noor is a new way to chat with teammates solving distraction, async threads and sync collaboration. BTW, it's free for communities. 

We're commited to building transparently and in the open, however as an early-stage startup with a small team we've been focused on delivering and open sourcing at a later point.
